# Sorting Bins

The sorting bin has an additional spot to hold a slip of paper or cardstock to label the contents of your bin and a hole for hanging the bins that is also helpful in grabbing and moving them about. 

The label holder is sized appropriately to accept a [standard microscope][amazon_miscroscope_slides] slide to keep your labels from getting dirty.
