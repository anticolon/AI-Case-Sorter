# Camera Module
The Camera Module consists of 4 parts:

## The Camera
The cameras is a USB camera module with a 100 degree lense, be sure you purchase the 100 degree lense variant as other lenses have not been tested and this will reduce compatability of AI training sets between your build and other peoples.

## Camera Body 
Print with supports only touching base and support overhange angle at 80 degrees. This will prevent supports from getting in the threads. 
If using Cura Slicer, use these support settings: 

* Support Structure: Normal,  
* Support Placement: Touching Buildplate, 
* Support Overhang Angle: 80.0, 
* Support Wall Line count: 0


## Camera Nut
This should be placed flat on the build plate and printed without supports. 

## Camera Module Lid
Should be printed with the flat part down with supports on to suport the clips. 
If you are getting breakage at the clips or poor layer adhesion, you can print this part on its side with supports for greater strength. 
Recommend use of PLA+ for this part.
