# Camera Module
The Camera Module consists of 4 parts:

## The Camera
The cameras is a USB camera module with a 100 degree lense, be sure you purchase the 100 degree lense variant as other lenses have not been tested and this will reduce compatability of AI training sets between your build and other peoples.

## Camera Body 
It is reccomended that the camera body is printed without the use of supports because it is very dificult to remove support material from the threads. 

## Camera Nut
Again this should be placed flat on the build plate and printed without supports. 

## Camera Module Lid
Should be printed with the flat part down with supports on to suport the clips.
