# Classifier
The classifier takes in brass via the feed nozzel, Imaged it using the camera module and drops it out the drop nozzle. 

It is reccomended that the classifier is built as the second module of the build so that you can build your training set while the sorting module is printing. 

It is reccomended that anyone starting with this project does so using the CS7 build
